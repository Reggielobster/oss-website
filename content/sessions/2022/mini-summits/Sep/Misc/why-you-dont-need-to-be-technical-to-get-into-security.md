description  : Security is a fun field, with so many opportunities. Yet, why is it when people think of security it's a hacker in a hoodie? Why is it people think we have to be computer geniuses to be in the field?  There are so many people that may not have traditional industry skills that would be an excellent fit for this industry! 

This talk will tell presenter Ashley's Burke's story on how they entered security with a non traditional background and how they managed to leverage their transferable skills to get a foot in the door. From there we will look at how to recognize your own transferable skills, recognize imposter syndrome and realize security is a space for everyone, from lots of different backgrounds!

Join Ashley on a journey of self discovery, laughs and confidence building while recognizing that we all have what it takes to make a lasting impression in the security world!
